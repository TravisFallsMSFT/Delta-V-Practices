# Delta-V-Practices

## What is this repository?
This is a place that represents internal discussions around the way we operate as a team. You are free to add your own opinions knowing that this will open a discussion with the team for what process we'd like to collectively adopt. 

Ensuring that we come to an agreement that everyone is happy with is a top priority. Much of the information for good engineering practices can be found in the [CSE Engineering Playbook](https://github.com/microsoft/code-with-engineering-playbook). What we hope to add here is the "*how*" we use these processes, more than the "*what*" these processes should be.

## Culture

The main idea behind having a document like this is so we have a place to point to and say "we are committing the best code we can."

It is also to promote a team culture that embraces learning and asking questions without fear of being shamed or guilt-ridden. 

The term "Delta-V" comes from the mathematical change in velocity. To metaphorically apply this to our team, it represents the change in working together and constantly becoming more efficient as we grow. Our commitment is to always focus on growth and doing what's right for the customer, but also for ourselves.
