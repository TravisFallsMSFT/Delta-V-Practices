# Delta-V Team Practices
## Potential Logo
Below is a potential logo for our team.  This is simply a start to put some "paint" on the wall.  We can change it or scrap it, it is simply a starting point so we can have a bit of fun with an identity.

## What is this repository?
This is a place that represents internal discussions and artifacts about the way we operate as a team and "brand" ourselves. We are free to add our opinions.  This will open a discussion with the team for what process we'd like to collectively adopt. 

Ensuring that we come to an agreement that everyone is satisfied with is priority. Much  information regarding good engineering practices can be found in the [CSE Engineering Playbook](https://github.com/microsoft/code-with-engineering-playbook). What we hope to add here is the "*how*" we use these processes and augment them with additional resources rather than simply another list of "*what*" these processes should be.

## Culture

The main idea behind having a document like this is so we have a place to point to and say "we are committing the best code we can.".

It is also to promote a team culture that embraces learning and asking questions without fear of being shamed or guilt-ridden.

### Why the Name "Delta-V"
The term ["Delta-V"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-v) as defined in Wikipedia comes from the mathematical change in velocity.  Delta-V (literally "change in velocity") is also used as the  measure of "impulse" per-unit of mass needed to perform maneuvers with regard to spacecraft.  An example would be a spacecraft landing on a planet.  

To metaphorically apply this to our team, it represents "our" change in velocity; as a team; as engineers; as individuals.  This change is in working together and constantly becoming more thoughtful, introspective engineers.  This change is in our desire to constantly striving to be more efficient as we grow together. 


## Our Commitments to Each Other
Below are a few behavior patterns that we commit to strive to incorporate into our team dynamics on Delta-V.  

### Our Commitments
1. Focus on growth as individuals, both as engineers, and as citizens of Terra (Earth).   
2. Stedfast commit to doing "what is right" for our customer from their perspective.
3. Engineering quality and stewardship is in the foreground of all our efforts
4. Committed to ever evolving the SCRUM methodology to make the as practical and efficient for Delta-V as possible while still maintaining quality standards
5.
