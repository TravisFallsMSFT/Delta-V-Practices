# Kaizen
## Introduction
The term "Kaizen" has become popular again in the business and software engineering world.  The term Kaizen comes from two specific Japanese words:
- Kai - Change
- Zen - Good

The term does not mean "Change Good", but rather carries the sentiment of continuous improvement.

Originally the inception of the term is from US war-time engineering.  This time in history necessitated quick and implementable improvement as some pressures and changing demands would not permit larger, more complex change.  

Since it's origins the term has evolved into a management philosophy that was adopted by many companies.  It is desireable for it's philosophy for constant improvement in an unending pursuit for perfection in all areas of a team's performance.  Including the team dynamic it's self.
