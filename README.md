# Delta-V-Practices

## What is this repository?
This is a place that represents internal discussions around the way we operate as a team. You are free to add your own opinions knowing that this will open a discussion with the team for what process we'd like to collectively adopt. 

Ensuring that we come to an agreement that everyone is happy with is a top priority. Much of the information for good engineering practices can be found in the [CSE Engineering Playbook](https://github.com/microsoft/code-with-engineering-playbook). What we hope to add here is the "*how*" we use these processes, more than the "*what*" these processes should be.
